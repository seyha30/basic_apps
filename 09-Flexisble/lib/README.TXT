“This widget is similar to the Expanded widget in that it expands the child Widget, except that it is a little more flexible in regard to Constraints.
When child widgets have Constraints (for example minimum, maximum dimension) then:
Expanded Widgets always respect those Constraints, never overriding them.
Flexible Widgets have the following fit options:
Fit ‘expanded’: expands to fit the available screen space, overriding the Constraints.
Fit ‘loose’ expands to fit the available screen space, respecting those Constraints, never overriding them.”
